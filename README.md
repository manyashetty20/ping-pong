# Project: Real-Time Ping Pong

This project is a terminal-based ping pong game using **Pygame**. It introduces students to interactive game design using object-oriented principles and real-time graphical rendering.

---

## What’s Provided

A partially working version of a ping pong game with:

- Player and AI-controlled paddles
- Ball movement with basic collision
- Score display

You are expected to **analyze**, **interact with an AI assistant**, and **complete/fix** the game to make it fully functional.

---

## Getting Started

### Setup

1. Clone the repo or download the project folder.
2. Make sure you have Python 3.10+ installed.
3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the game:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Initial Prompt Template (To Use With LLM)

Use this to begin your interaction with the LLM:

```
I’m working on a real-time Ping Pong game using Python and Pygame. I have a partially working project structure. Please help me understand how the logic is organized and guide me on implementing missing features. Review any code I send to ensure it aligns with the expected behavior.
```

## Tasks to Complete

Each task must be completed using an iterative process involving LLM suggestions and your critical code review.

### Task 1: Refine Ball Collision

> The ball sometimes passes through paddles at high speed. Investigate and enhance collision accuracy.

### Task 2: Implement Game Over Condition

> Add a screen that displays the winner once one player reaches a defined score (e.g., 5), then gracefully exits or restarts.

### Task 3: Add Replay Option

> After Game Over, allow the user to play again with best of 3, 5, or 7 option, or exit.

### Task 4: Add Sound Feedback

> Add basic sound effects for paddle hit, wall bounce, and score.

## Expected Behavior

- Smooth paddle movement using `W` and `S`
- AI tracks and plays competitively
- Ball rebounds on paddle and wall hits
- Score updates on each miss
- Game ends and optionally restarts when limit reached
